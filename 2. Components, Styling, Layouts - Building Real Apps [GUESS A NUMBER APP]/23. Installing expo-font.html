<p>Depending on the version of Expo you're using, you very likely need to install the <code>expo-font</code> package.</p><p>You can do this in <strong>two different ways</strong> and it's important to understand the difference:</p><p>1) <code>npm install --save expo-font</code></p><p>2)&nbsp;<code>expo install expo-font</code></p><p>2)&nbsp;is recommended - but what is the difference?</p><p><code>npm install</code> installs a packages a dependency into the project - we use this command for most packages which we do install.</p><p>Some packages (typically all <code>expo-*</code> packages) can break the app if you install the wrong version though - because they closely work together with Expo itself.</p><p>To get the right package version for the specific version of Expo your app relies on, <code>expo install</code> is the right "tool". It also just executes <code>npm install</code> behind the scenes <strong>but it picks a specific (i.e. the correct)&nbsp;version</strong> of the package to be installed.</p><p>Hence for all <code>expo-*</code> packages, <code>npm install</code> can be used but <code><strong>expo install</strong></code><strong> is the preferred command</strong> to avoid errors. Of course you could always try <code>npm install</code> first and only run <code>expo install</code> if you thereafter do face any errors.</p>
