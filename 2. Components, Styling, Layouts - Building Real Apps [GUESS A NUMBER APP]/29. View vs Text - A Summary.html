<p><code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;View&gt;</code> are probably <strong>THE&nbsp;most important/ most-used components</strong> built into React Native.</p><p>---</p><p><code>&lt;View&gt;</code> is your #1 component if you need to group and structure content (=&nbsp;provide a layout) and/ or if you want to style something as a container (e.g. the <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code>&nbsp;look we built in our custom <code>&lt;Card&gt;</code>&nbsp;component).</p><p><code>&lt;View&gt;</code> uses <strong>Flexbox</strong> to organize its children - have a look at the Flexbox deep dive earlier in this course (<strong>in module 2</strong>) to learn more about how that works.</p><p>A <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>&nbsp;can hold as many child components as you need and it also works with any kind of child component - it can hold <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> components, other <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>s&nbsp;(for nested containers/&nbsp;layouts), <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code>s, custom components etc.</p><p>If you need scrolling, you should consider using a <code>&lt;ScrollView&gt;</code> - you could wrap your <code>&lt;View&gt;</code> with it or replace your <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>&nbsp;(that depends on your layout and styling). Please note, that due to its scrollable nature, Flexbox works a bit differently on a <code>&lt;ScrollView&gt;</code>:&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46805135/scrollview-with-flex-1-makes-it-un-scrollable" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46805135/scrollview-with-flex-1-makes-it-un-scrollable</a></p><p>---</p><p><code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> is also super important. As its name suggests, you use it for outputting text (of any length). You can also <strong>nest other </strong><code><strong>&lt;Text&gt;</strong></code><strong> components</strong> into a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>. Actually, you can also have nested <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>s inside of a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> but that comes with certain caveats you should watch out for:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a2a03bc68ba062a96a6971d3791d291f49794dfd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/a2a03bc68ba062a96a6971d3791d291f49794dfd</a></p><p>Unlike <code>&lt;View&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> does<strong> NOT use Flexbox</strong> for organizing its content (i.e. the text or nested components). Instead, text inside of <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> automatically fills a line as you would expect it and wraps into a new line if the text is too long for the available <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> width.</p><p>You can avoid wrapping by setting the <code>numberOfLines</code> prop, possibly combined with <code>ellipsizeMode</code>. </p><p>Example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;Text numberOfLines={1} ellipsizeMode="tail"&gt;
  This text will never wrap into a new line, instead it will be cut off like this if it is too lon...
&lt;/Text&gt;</pre><p><strong>Also important</strong>:&nbsp;When adding styles to a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>&nbsp;(no matter if that happens via inline styles or a <code>StyleSheet</code> object), the styles will actually be shared with any nested <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> components.</p><p>This <strong>differs from the behavior</strong> of <code>&lt;View&gt;</code> (or actually any other component - <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> is the exception):&nbsp;There, any styles are <strong>only applied to the component to which you add them</strong>. Styles are never shared with any child component!</p>
